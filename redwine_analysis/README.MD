# Analysis of the Red Wine Quality Dataset

## Overview

### Introduction
This project relies on data loaded from Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). To get a better feel of data and find useful patterns Pandas, visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn will be performed. Subsequently, the creation of linear regression models will be executed utilizing the capabilities of both the statsmodels and sklearn packages.

### Objectives
The main purpose of the analysis will be to understand wine properties, how they relate to each other, and their influence on wine quality and alcohol level. Insights and predictions will be gained by applying various data analysis techniques and machine learning models to the provided dataset.

During the analysis, the primary focus will include:

1. Determining Relationships and Correlations:
   - The available data will be explored to uncover relationships and correlations among different features.
   - Patterns and dependencies will be identified, contributing to a deeper understanding of the wine production process.
2. Predicting Alcohol and Quality Features:
   - Various predictive modeling techniques will be employed to accurately estimate alcohol content and quality based on the available data.
   - To iterate and refine models to achieve the highest prediction accuracy, which will inform and enhance decision-making processes in wine production quality control.
3. Summarizing Results and Generating Business Value:
   - The analysis outcomes will be compiled into a comprehensive summary that details key findings and model performances.
   - Insights will be contextualized to provide actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing production efficiency.
