# Analysis of Podcast Reviews  Dataset Project

## Overview

This project relies on data loaded from Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews/versions/28) and processed using Pandas. To get a better feel of data and find useful patterns, the queries and filtering data using SQLite, Pandas, visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn will be performed.

The main purpose of the analysis is to provide useful information to podcast publishers and sponsors, based on the insights that will be gained by applying various data analysis technique for the above mentioned data set.

The steps and procedures that will be included in the analysis of this document are:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The first phase involves loading the data from the SQLite database using Pandas. Any required data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and data type conversions, will be performed during this stage.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive EDA will be conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This includes generating statistical summaries, creating visualizations, identifying outliers, and exploring relationships between variables. Correlations, patterns, and trends within the data will be examined to inform subsequent analysis steps.

Statistical Inference: Statistical inference will be employed to make meaningful conclusions about the population based on the sample data. This will involve formulating hypotheses, constructing confidence intervals, and conducting hypothesis tests using z tests, t tests as appropriate.

Interpretation and Conclusion: The analysis findings will be interpreted in the context of the research objectives. Limitations of the analysis will be acknowledged, and conclusions will be drawn based on the results obtained.

Google Data Studio Dashboard: A Google Data Studio dashboard will be designed to present the analysis results visually. The dashboard will include at least three types of charts that effectively convey key findings and insights from the analysis.
